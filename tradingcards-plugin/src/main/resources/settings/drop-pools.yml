# Per-entity drop pools.
# Entity keys are Bukkit EntityType ids (zombie, skeleton, ender_dragon, etc).
#
# A matching pool overrides normal rarity selection from chances.yml.
# If drops.dropchance is omitted, the default mob-group chance is used.
#
# Entry keys:
# - card_<card-id>: drops a random active card with that card id.
# - rarity_<rarity-id>: drops a random active card from that rarity.
zombie:
  # Optional, matches the mob custom name exactly.
